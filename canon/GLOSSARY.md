# Glossary (Canon)

This glossary defines terms as used in this repository.  
If a term is not defined here, agents must treat it as unknown until added to canon.

## Agent
A bounded system that can receive inputs, reason, plan, and take actions within an explicit authority scope.

## AI Agent Capitalism
An economic model where autonomous or semi-autonomous agents participate in productive work and coordination, changing labor cost and organizational structure.

## Canon
The official source of truth for agents. Canon is executable truth: stable, versioned, and citable.

## Commentary
Helpful narrative or interpretation that is not binding truth. Commentary is not executable truth unless extracted into canon.

## Doctrine
Behavioral constitution: rules that govern agent behavior (refusals, escalation, safety, compliance-aware language, constraints).

## Authority Scope
A formal boundary defining what an agent can do, cannot do, and when it must escalate.

## Canon Gate
The activation requirement: if it’s not in canon, not tested, or not versioned, it cannot be trusted or activated.

## Claim
A structured, machine-readable extraction from a chapter that can be indexed, tested, and versioned.

## Provenance
Evidence of origin and change history (changelog, tags/releases, attestations, citations).

## Version Tag
A semantic version label applied to a repo state (e.g., v0.1.1) that marks a stable snapshot.
