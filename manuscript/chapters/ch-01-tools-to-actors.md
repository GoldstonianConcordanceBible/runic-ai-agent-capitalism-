# Chapter 1 — The Shift: From Tools to Actors

AI used to be something you opened.
Now it is something you deploy.

A tool waits.
An agent acts within boundaries.

AI Agent Capitalism begins when software can:
1. Receive input
2. Reason about goals
3. Choose a plan
4. Act

Action changes economics.

## The Core Shift

Humans + Tools → Humans + Agents

Agents become bounded workers:
- Scoped
- Logged
- Versioned
- Governed

## Production Rule

Write → Canonize → Activate

A chapter is not production-ready until:
- Claims are extracted
- Safety rules updated
- Version tag created

## Why This Matters

Agents require:
- Canon (truth layer)
- Authority (permission layer)
- Accountability (logging + versioning)

Without structure, agents drift.
With structure, agents scale.
