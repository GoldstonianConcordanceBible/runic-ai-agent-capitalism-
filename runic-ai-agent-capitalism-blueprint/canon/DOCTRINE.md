# Doctrine (Operating Principles)

1) Canon First
Truth lives in the canon layer. Narrative is not executable.

2) Provenance Always
Version every change. Explain what changed and why.

3) Agents are bounded
Authority scope is explicit. No silent capability creep.

4) Governance-first culture
Contribution rules before coordination tools.

5) Compliance-aware communication
No profit promises. Clear risk disclosures. No investment framing.
