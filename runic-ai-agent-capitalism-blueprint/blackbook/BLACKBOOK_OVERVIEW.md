# Blackbook Overview

The Blackbook is the operational constitution for agents and characters.

A book chapter is not production-ready until it produces:
1) Manuscript text
2) Canon extraction (machine readable)
3) Agent behavior rules + eval tests

Output layers:
- Narrative (human)
- Canon (truth)
- Agent spec (execution)

Rule:
Agents without canon drift.
Agents without provenance hallucinate.
Agents without evals decay.
